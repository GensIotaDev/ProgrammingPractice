# Note

This is my collection of completed challenges from CodeWars, LeetCode and AdventOfCode.

## CodeWars

As this was an aggregate of solutions across 4 years, many challenges have (xUnit) test classes but not all. I only started using TDD on these a year or two after I joined CodeWars and only for challenges that were more complex or had odd edge cases in the submission stage.
